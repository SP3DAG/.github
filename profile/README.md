# GeoCam

GeoCam is a study project developed by the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of Münster.
In today's digital landscape, disinformation and manipulated media - especially photos and videos - are a growing problem. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to trust the authenticity of visual content.
                    
GeoCam addresses this challenge by allowing users to capture cryptographically signed and geotagged images. These 'geo-signed' images include proof of when and where they were taken, offering a higher level of trust and integrity.
                    
The app is intended as a technical demonstration: users can capture geo-signed images, share them with others, and later validate their authenticity using GeoCam’s verification tools.
                    
This makes GeoCam a potential foundation for combating visual disinformation in journalism, science, and civic documentation.
